# `cout << "hello! world\n";` ✨  

## 👋 Hi, I'm Itou Souta!

Welcome to my world!  
I’m a **high school student from Taiwan** with a passion for **C++**, **web development**, and **cybersecurity**.  
This space is where I document my experiments, learning notes, and personal projects. I believe that every line of code is a journey to better understand the world and myself.

## 🌟 About Me

- 🏫 First-year high school student in Taiwan  
- 🌏 Trilingual: Chinese (native), English, Japanese  
- 🎮 Enjoy solving algorithm and geometry problems, especially creative or visual ones  
- 💡 Passionate about exploring the intersection of programming, cybersecurity, and creativity  
- 📚 Lifelong learner always on the hunt for new challenges and knowledge  

## 🚀 Current Goals

- 🔥 Improve my C++ skills for both competitive programming and practical projects  
- 🌐 Build modern responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Hexo  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Dive into cybersecurity fundamentals: CTFs, network analysis, white-hat tools  
- 🤖 Experiment with AI integration and automation  
- 📝 Keep writing and sharing technical notes  
- 💡 Keep seeking intersections between creativity and technology  

## 📚 My Learning Journey

I started coding out of curiosity about how websites and games are made,  
and gradually fell in love with algorithms, competitive programming, and cybersecurity.  
I enjoy participating in online competitions and CTFs.

Recently, I’ve been exploring frontend frameworks, static site generators, and experimenting with AI tools.  
My goal is to create useful, visually appealing, and secure digital experiences.

## 🎯 Aspirations

- 🏆 Join more competitive programming contests and CTFs  
- 📖 Master advanced C++ and design patterns  
- 🌍 Launch a trilingual tech blog and share tutorials  
- 🛡️ Develop and contribute to open-source cybersecurity tools  
- 🤝 Collaborate and learn from other developers  

## 💬 My Philosophy

"Every bug is a learning experience. Every project is a story.  
The best way to learn is to get your hands dirty, be bold, then refactor.”

I believe in knowledge sharing, collaboration, and staying curious.  
If you have an interesting project, a question, or just want to talk tech—feel free to reach out!
